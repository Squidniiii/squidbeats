# squidbeats

Your first mistake was trying to download this.

## Requirements:

Python version: 3.5.3

Download Python here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/]

Download discord.py: [https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/]

It is recommended that you do this in a Python virtual environment but idgaf what do i know i'm doing this for the meme

## Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Squidniiii/squidbeats.git
```
Navigate to the `mmmusic` folder. run:

```
py bot.py
```

on Windows or

```
python bot.py
```
on Linux. 

If all works well you should see a message similar to this:

```
SquidBeats#7420 has connected to Discord!
```

This will create an instance of SquidBeats on your local device. If you just want to use the bot, I'll probably put a link here once I fix perms
